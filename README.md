Overview of project:

 A simple calculator created using Python typically involves basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and possibly more advanced functionalities like exponentiation or modulus operations. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what such a calculator might include:

User Interface: It could have a command-line interface (CLI) where the user enters numbers and operations via text input.

Operations Supported:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Input Handling: The calculator would need to handle user input, parse it into operands and operators, and then perform the specified operation.

Error Handling: Basic error handling would ensure that division by zero or invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values where numbers are expected) are managed gracefully.

Functionality: Beyond basic operations, you might choose to include features like:

Handling floating-point numbers.
Handling negative numbers.
Trigonometric functions (if extending beyond a simple calculator).
Memory functions (storing results for later use).
Code Structure: Typically, such a calculator could be implemented in Python using functions or classes to encapsulate different operations and provide modularity.
